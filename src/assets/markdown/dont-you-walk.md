# Don't You Walk

## Am-E-D

Woke up this morning,
God, what did I do?
Reached my arm over and, where were you?

The best thing I had going and I threw it all away.
I sat up and cried, and the sky went grey.

Won't you talk,
Oh baby don't you walk.
Oh won't you talk,
won't you talk to me now, cuz I still need you.

Patching up is easy,
But we must refrain.
We could probably benefit from a little pain.

A heart as hard as mine can be so tragic in your mind.
But stone has no defense against the hands of time.

Won't you talk,
Oh baby don't you walk.
Oh won't you talk,
won't you talk to me now, cuz I still need you.

I can’t be held responsible
For what might have been.
I can be invincible after a little sin.

Tear my clothes off of me and you’ll see what I’ve become:
A shallow freak unable to stand up for what he’s done.

Won't you talk,
Oh baby don't you walk.
Oh won't you talk,
won't you talk to me now, cuz I still need you.
