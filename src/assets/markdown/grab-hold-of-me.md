# Grab Hold of Me

## G-D-Em-C

Capo 2nd

You think too much,
You sink too much,
The weight is on your chest again,

Any port in a storm,
myth without form,
Now you think you're blessed again.

What'd you do this time,
what'd you do this time,
did you think it or try it?

What'd you do this time,
what'd you do this time,
did you steal it or buy it?

I see that you're not well,
I hope I'm not too late,
uncomfortable in your skin,
don't get hasty now,
just wait.
And any time you're fallin' just grab hold of me.
Grab hold of me,
yeah I'll help you, if you want to,
just grab hold of me.

So what is your problem,
turn down the volume,
You're losing your patience.
You'll always have friends,
ears are easy to lend,
Maybe you need a vacation.

What's different this time,
What's different this time,
With anything you say,
What's different this time,
What's different this time,
Are you really okay?

I see that you're not well,
I hope I'm not too late,
uncomfortable in your skin,
don't get hasty now,
just wait.
And any time you're fallin' just grab hold of me.
Grab hold of me,
yeah I'll help you, if you want to,
just grab hold of me.
