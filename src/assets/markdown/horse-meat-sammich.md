Capo 2nd

Well I’ll pack up all my beer cans and count up all my change
Take a cash advance on my credit card and buy a sack today
I’m done with all my finals and my time is all but free
So I'll fire up the Xbox and burn some THC.

It’s a terrible affliction says my mother and dad
I can’t remember most of it so it can’t be all that bad
And if I wake up tomorrow and I don’t know where I am
That’ll be just fine because at least this time I’ll follow through with my plan

Hours turn to minutes when I waste them all away
There are things that I’ve left unfinished
But I have to laugh when I remember that it won’t matter at all one day
I have to laugh when I remember that it won’t matter at all one day
One day

Now I can’t forget the one thing that takes my cotton mouth away
That tasty cheap malt beverage from the heart of Milwaukee
I don’t need no calculator to know just where I stand
Buy the cheapest swill with my dollar bill in a shiny golden can

I’ve got dirty laundry piled by my bed
And I have some cash to do it but I bought some weed instead
I owe my first born child to the power company
But the jokes on them I’m sterile from smoking all those seeds

Hours turn to minutes when I waste them all away
There are things that I’ve left unfinished
But I have to laugh when I remember that it won’t matter at all one day
I have to laugh when I remember that it won’t matter at all one day
One day

Now the way my grades are going I’m on the 8 year plan
But just don’t tell my mother she’ll kill me where I stand
And I sound like an addict but I swear that ain’t true
But when the rain outside is a tsunami tide there just ain’t that much to do

Hours turn to minutes when I waste them all away
There are things that I’ve left unfinished
But I have to laugh when I remember that it won’t matter at all one day
I have to laugh when I remember that it won’t matter at all one day
One day
